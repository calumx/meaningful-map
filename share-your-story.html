          All of us experience Glasgow in a slightly different way. It is
          precisely that variety which makes it so exciting and full of life.

          You don't have to be a born storyteller to contribute to this tale.
          Our facilitators will guide you through the process and you might even
          surprise yourself with how much you've got to offer. All we ask is 1.5
          hours of your time, so that we can create a relaxed atmosphere and
          allow the memories to flow freely.
