He’s much happier here.</p><p>The Meaningful Map of Glasgow started as my personal project, born from an interest in placemaking and collective meaning. I would love to see it grow beyond those initial stages to eventually become a truly collaborative, open project owned by all Glaswegians.</p><p>For now, it’s my way of experiencing Glasgow through the eyes of its people, falling in love with it more and more; one story at a time. Join me in capturing its beauty!</p></div>
