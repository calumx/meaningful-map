            The Meaningful Map of Glasgow is, and always will be,
            non-commercial. It was not commissioned by any company or public
            organisation and so has got no hidden agenda beyond curious
            exploration.
          </p>
          <p>
            Rather, it starts as a personal project that will hopefully develop
            with your help into a fully collaborative effort. If there is a
            community appetite, I would be keen to open this up for workshops
            and a dedicated forum. Ideally we will all decide the course of the
            project and its final form together.

          All contributors will be informed of any signifcant future plans or
          potential collaborations. However, no data will ever be sold to any
          private company.
